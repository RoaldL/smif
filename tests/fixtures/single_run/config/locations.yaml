# Data structure for specifiying possible locations
# - each location has (name, type, geography), with the structure here avoiding
#   the repeated declaration of type for each location
#
# Then:
# - each asset must have a location
# - each asset type must have a set of locations in which any of its type can be
#   built, e.g. specified by location type 1-1
#
# - how do we constrain the count of assets buildable in a location?
# - when computing the list of all possible decisions in the capacity-expansion
#   problem, do we introduce one entry per buildable asset?
